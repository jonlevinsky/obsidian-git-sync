<center class="scene-heading">## INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</center>
The room is dimly lit, shadows casting long lines on the floor. A clock ticks loudly in the background.

<center class="character">**JOHN DOE** (V.O.)</center>
(softly)  
I never thought it would come to this.

The door creaks open. A figure steps into the room, silhouetted against the hallway light.

<center class="character">**JANE DOE**</center>
(whispers)  
John... It's time.

<center class="character">**JOHN DOE**</center>
(eyes wide)  
No... Not yet.

Jane moves closer, her footsteps quiet but deliberate.

<center class="character">**JOHN DOE**</center>
(suddenly loud)  
You don't understand! I can't do it!

<center class="character">**JANE DOE**</center>
(cutting him off)  
You have to. It's the only way.

John looks at her for a long moment, torn between fear and determination.

<center class="character">**JOHN DOE**</center>
(quietly, defeated)  
Fine. But if this goes wrong...

<center class="character">**JANE DOE**</center>
(interrupting, sternly)  
It won't.

They stand in silence, the tension palpable.

<center class="scene-heading">## EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT</center>
The city lights flicker below, an endless sea of neon. The wind howls.

A man, wearing a long coat, stands at the edge, looking down.

<center class="character">**JOHN DOE**</center>
(looking at the city)  
It all ends here.

He steps forward, the wind tugging at his coat, as if the city itself is calling him.

<center class="transition">**CUT TO:**</center>

<center class="scene-heading">## INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT</center>
The room is completely dark, save for a flickering light coming from an old lamp in the corner. The sound of a distant door creaking open fills the air.
